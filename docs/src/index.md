Jmespathh-filters is a library providing a filtering utility for JSON payloads.

You can use it to evaluate a payload against an Expression and check if it is a match.

The Expression is based on the [JMESPath query language for JSON](https://jmespath.org/).
On the [JMESPath website](https://jmespath.org/) you can also find an interactive form for testing the syntax.

See [Examples](./examples) for some example about how to use it.
